### 6️⃣ Charlotte Housing – Streamlit App

**Short description**  
Interactive Streamlit web app for predicting house prices in Huntersville, NC.  
The backend uses a Random Forest model trained on Redfin market data (historical prices and market metrics).

**What I did**
- Collected and cleaned Redfin TSV data using **pandas**.
- Built and evaluated a **RandomForestRegressor** model in **scikit-learn**.
- Saved the trained model to a `.pkl` file and loaded it inside a **Streamlit** app.
- Designed a simple UI where the user enters square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, year built, and ZIP code → the app returns an estimated house price.
